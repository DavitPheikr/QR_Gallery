The web-based platform allows users to scan a QR code and access a site where they can quickly sign up or log in. Once they're in, they can snap a photo at a tourist attraction using the camera feature. After taking their shot, they unlock a gallery filled with other users' pictures from the same spot, where they can like or dislike photos, with the most popular ones getting the spotlight. Users can explore profiles to see favorite shots and visited locations, and if they run into any hiccups, customer support is always ready to help! Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL and is currently in active development.
